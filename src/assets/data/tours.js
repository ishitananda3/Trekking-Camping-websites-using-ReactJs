The route takes us climbing over a ridge that offer an almost 360 panoramic view overlooking a massive lake. The landscape is untouched by human activity and is left wild & raw. The area is covered in thick shrubbery and grass. There is good reason why we have been hosting hike in this destination since the past 10 years.",
